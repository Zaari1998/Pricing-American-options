# Pricing-American-options
#### * The determination of the fair price of an American option, which gives the holder the right to exercise the option at any time before its expiration date, is a challenging problem in the field of financial mathematics. 
#### * In this project, our objective is to compare and apply pricing methods for American options.
#### * We first provide a detailed description of the key elements of a classic option, including the type of option, the underlying asset, the quantity of the underlying asset, the expiration date, and the strike price.
#### * We then discuss the pricing and hedging problems associated with selling options and present the theoretical framework for pricing American options.
#### * We implement the above-mentioned pricing methods for a range of American options with varying strike prices, underlying assets, and expiration dates. We compare the accuracy and efficiency of these methods.
